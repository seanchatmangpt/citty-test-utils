ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: extract imported commands
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: build command hierarchy
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: validate structure integrity
ASTEngine --> Discover: CLI structure
deactivate ASTEngine

Discover --> CLI: CLI structure report
deactivate Discover
CLI --> Dev: ✅ CLI structure discovered

note right of Discover
  **🔍 Discovery Results:**
  - Commands: 5 discovered
  - Subcommands: 15 discovered
  - Flags: 8 discovered
  - Options: 3 discovered
  - Imports: 5 resolved
end note

Dev -> CLI: ctu analysis coverage --test-dir test
CLI -> Router: route coverage command

activate Coverage

Coverage -> ASTEngine: discoverTestPatternsAST()
activate ASTEngine
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: scan test directory
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: parse test file ASTs
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: extract test patterns
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: calculate coverage
ASTEngine --> Coverage: coverage statistics
deactivate ASTEngine

Coverage --> CLI: coverage analysis report
deactivate Coverage
CLI --> Dev: 📊 Coverage: 75% overall

note right of Coverage
  **📊 Coverage Results:**
  - Commands: 4/5 (80%)
  - Subcommands: 12/15 (80%)
  - Flags: 6/8 (75%)
  - Options: 2/3 (67%)
  - Overall: 24/31 (77%)
end note

Dev -> CLI: ctu analysis recommend --priority high
CLI -> Router: route recommend command
Router -> Recommend: execute recommendations
activate Recommend

Recommend -> ASTEngine: generateRecommendations()
activate ASTEngine
ASTEngine -> ASTEngine: analyze coverage gaps

ASTEngine --> Recommend: smart recommendations
deactivate ASTEngine

Recommend --> CLI: recommendation report
deactivate Recommend
CLI --> Dev: 💡 5 high-priority recommendations

note right of Recommend
  **💡 Smart Recommendations:**
  1. [HIGH] Add tests for 'export' command
  2. [HIGH] Add tests for '--verbose' flag
  3. [MEDIUM] Add tests for 'compare' subcommand
  4. [MEDIUM] Add tests for '--format' option
  5. [LOW] Add tests for '--output' option
end note
