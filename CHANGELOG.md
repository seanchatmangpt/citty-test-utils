npx citty-test-utils info version
npx citty-test-utils gen project my-cli
npx citty-test-utils runner execute "node --version"
```

#### Template Generation
New template generation capabilities:

```bash
# Generate complete projects
npx citty-test-utils gen project my-cli

# Generate individual templates
npx citty-test-utils gen test my-test
npx citty-test-utils gen scenario my-scenario
npx citty-test-utils gen cli my-cli
```

#### Enhanced Testing
The testing framework now includes comprehensive integration tests and snapshot testing. All existing programmatic APIs remain compatible.
